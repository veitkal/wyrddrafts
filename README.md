# wyrddrafts

This site contains the early workings and gatherings of experimental digital hand weaving tools. They are/will be more or less usefull pieces of software aimed towards exploring pattern and draft making for weaving, textile craft and beyond.

It is part of an ongoing artistic research project concerning textile and digital technologies, pattern making/reading, (im)material encounters and relations, creativity, ethics, ontology and wide ranges of weird topics.

The project is kindly supported by The Swedish National Handicraft Counsil.

As of now only a few written words and tools are presented here, but many more will come.

Feel free to explore the content of the site and use and create of it what you will!

## TODO / ROADMAP

This project is very much in its infancy as is in developement. 
At the moment it is more of a sketchmap of promising yet unknown terrains.
There are many large and small things plotted out to be built within this frame.
Here follows some specific things that are currently being worked on.

### DRIFTING DRAFTS
- Fix export scaling
- Set responsive init warp/weft count
- Add additional generators closer to the core ideas behind the app
- Add a "delete last thread" for pattern repeat (ie to be able to mirror sections without duplicate threadings /\)
- Add more ways of generating color patterns
- Expand color pattern expression capabilities

### DRIFTING DRAFTS
This whole app is very much a placeholder

### GENERAL
Convert to JS naming convention
